# Drug-Consumption-Analysis

This project analyzes drug consumption patterns using machine learning. The dataset includes demographic, personality, and drug use information.

## Steps
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Loaded and cleaned the dataset.
   - Converted categorical drug use values to numeric.
   - Calculated and visualized correlations with the target variable (`Cannabis`).

2. **Feature Selection**
   - Selected top features based on correlation with `Cannabis`.

3. **Modeling**
   - To be done: Train and evaluate a classification model.

## Repository Structure
- `drug_consumption_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the EDA and code.
- `README.md`: Project description and documentation.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
